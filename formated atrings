F-String was introduced in Python 3.6, and is now the preferred way of formatting strings.

To specify a string as an f-string, simply put an f in front of the string literal, and add curly brackets {} as placeholders for variables and other operations.

Example
Create an f-string:

age = 36
txt = f"My name is John, I am {age}"
print(txt)


A placeholder can include a modifier to format the value.

A modifier is included by adding a colon : followed by a legal formatting type, like .2f which means fixed point number with 2 decimals:

Example
Display the price with 2 decimals:

price = 59
txt = f"The price is {price:.2f} dollars"
print(txt)




You will get an error if you use double quotes inside a string that is surrounded by double quotes:

txt = "We are the so-called "Vikings" from the north."
To fix this problem, use the escape character \":

Example
The escape character allows you to use double quotes when you normally would not be allowed:

txt = "We are the so-called \"Vikings\" from the north."
